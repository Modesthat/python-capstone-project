# Bank Customer Churn Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing bank customer data to identify factors that contribute to customer churn. Using demographic, financial, and engagement information, we aim to uncover insights that can help the bank improve retention and optimize services.



##  Objective

--Get the data for each customer and accounts
--Examine and profile the data
--Prepare for visualisation
--Draw conclusion and recommendation
